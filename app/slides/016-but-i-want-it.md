But what if my subcomponents have subcomponents? Pass callbacks down another level?

* Manual
* Tedious
* Prone to user error & refactoring woes
  * Or every component has a direct line into the store

Component composition: bottom up or top down? Both :(

But we like virtual dom. Can we build out own?

## How does it even work?

I have no idea.

## But it doesn't matter
