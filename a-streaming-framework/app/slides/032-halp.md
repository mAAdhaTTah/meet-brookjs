## halp!

So yeah, this is a lot. And I can't do it alone.

We'll put it on [GitHub](https://github.com/valtech-us), get this out in front of people as fast as possible.

* Allow people to pull in from GitHub, but aggressively deprecate old features
* Close coordination on upgrades
  * Documentation, blog, regular updates
